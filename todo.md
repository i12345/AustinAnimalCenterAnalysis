# To do

- [ ] compare with [previous analysis](https://data.world/rdowns26/austin-animal-shelter)
- [x] correlate features of embeddings of names with adoption
- [ ] research and evaluate potential explanations for breeds, colors, sizes, and other variables
- [ ] make dynamic mix-breed info (this will probably remove breed-aggregate analysis)
  * Animal `A529609` was `Belgian Malinois/Australian Shepherd`. This dynamic mix would have to find the closest matching breeds `Belgian Sheepdog-Malinois` and `Australian Shepherd`. What is the vector embedding similarity threshold for this?
